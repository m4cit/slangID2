# Introducing slangID2.0

In a nutshell: The slangID project tries to detect slang phrases. Something literally no one asked for...

You can train a selection of classifiers, and print out a test set of phrases with the **DEMO** button.
Or you can type a phrase and see what type it is identified as. All the models are pre-trained, but you can re-train if needed.

# Challenges

Due to a lack of data, the results, regardless of the classifier used, are not good enough right now.
 Unknown words are also an issue since the dataset is tiny.

# Performance
In total, there are five classifiers you can choose from:

* Linear SVM (SVC with linear Kernel)
* Decision Tree
* Gaussian Naive Bayes
* Multinomial Naive Bayes
* Logistic Regression

Currently the **best performer** is the **Gaussian Naive Bayes model** with an **F<sub>1</sub> score of 0.70**.
 
**Logistic Regression** comes in second with **0.62**

**Multinomial Naive Bayes** and **Linear SVM** are tied with **0.61**

**Decision Tree** is the worst with **0.43** (changes after every training)

# How to run slangID2.0

1. Install Python **3.9** or later (3.8 and 3.10 is probably fine too, I used 3.9.12).
2. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your shell of choice. Make sure you are in the project directory.
3. And then run `python slangID2.0_Windows.py` or `python3 slangID2.0_Linux.py` (the difference between both versions is just the font size on some labels and buttons).

**Note:** It might take a while to load. Be patient.

# Source of the data

Most of the phrases are hand-picked and come from archive.org's [Twitter Stream of June 6th](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam-twitter-stream-2021-06).

Some come from me personally, which you might recognize due to their sad and depressing nature.

# Recognition of Open Source use

* scikit-learn
* pandas
